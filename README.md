# Advent of Code 2024

*Advent of Code 2024 puzzles solved using Elixir.*

I'm working on these solution with [Elixir LiveBook](https://livebook.dev/), which, like Jupyter notebooks, allows mixing Markdown and code, and incrementally executing code blocks.  In general, I try to push the first (messy, horrible) working version, and then clean it up in a later commit.
